# SampleCodeSteppen
Some sample code from my work at Steppen

This is just a small snapshot of some of the work that I did at Steppen - Note: It will obviously not work as is.

Included a few images showing some of the UI/UX that we went for.

Uses graphql for fetching/updating backend

Uses Magnus-ui for UI framework

Our CTO Dave said to blame any bad code on him. Haha. 
In saying that there is a mix of developers. While the included code was mainly owned by me we all performed bug fixes throughout the code or tweaked features as required so different styles may shine through. Including varying degrees of using TS.
